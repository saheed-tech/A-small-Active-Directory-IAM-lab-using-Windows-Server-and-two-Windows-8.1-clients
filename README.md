# Active Directory Simulation – CyberTech Solutions

This project is the deployment of a Windows Server Domain Controller (Active Directory) for a company called **CyberTech Solutions**. It includes domain setup, client configuration, OU design, group policies, and access control in an enterprise environment.

---

## Company Structure

**CyberTech Solutions** is a small IT services firm with the following structure:

- 1 x Windows Server (AD Domain Controller)
- 1 x Windows 8 Client PC (Account Department)
- 1 x Windows 7 Client PC (Legacy Software)

---

## Project Objectives

- Configure an AD Domain Controller on Windows Server
- Join client PCs to the domain
- Create Organizational Units (OUs)
- Implement basic Group Policies for access control
- Simulate a centralized IT environment

|---------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| Windows Server| 10.0.5.5  | AD Domain Controller (DC)   |
| Windows 8 PC  | DHCP    | Client (Accounts)           |
| Windows XP PC | DHCP    | Legacy Client               |

## Domain Configuration

- **Domain Name**: `cybertech.local`
- **Server Name**: `CYBERTECH`
- **Static IP**: `10.0.5.5`
- **AD Roles Installed**: AD DS, DNS (DHCP)

---

## Organizational Units (OUs)

Created using **Active Directory Users and Computers**:

```
CyberTech.local
├── OU: IT Department
│   └── Users: Alex.IT
    └── Users: Charles.IT

├── OU: Sales
│   └── Users:
```

---

## Group Policy (GPO)

Created and linked using **Group Policy Management Console (gpmc.msc)**:

- **GPO Name**: `DisableRemovableDrives`
- **Linked to**: OU: IT Department
- **Policy Configured**:
  - `Computer Configuration` > `Administrative Templates` > `System` > `Removable Storage Access`
  - Set **"All Removable Storage classes: Deny all access"** to **Enabled**

Result: USB and external drives are disabled for all users in the **Accounts OU**.

## Key Takeaways

- Gained practical experience with Windows Server roles and domain setup
- Implemented centralized access control using Group Policy
- Learned how to structure users and departments with OUs
- Applied IAM concepts in a real-world simulated environment
